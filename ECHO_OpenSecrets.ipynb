    "* If you click on a gray **code** cell, a little “play button” arrow appears on the left. If you click the play button, it will run the code in that cell (“**running** a cell”). The button will animate. When the animation stops, the cell has finished running.\n",

The idea came from the exercise that Kelsey ran us through in the ESIP Summer Meeting (July 23, 2021). This is a work in progress exploration of the idea with some thoughts on how it could be put into production.\n",

My conclusion is that it might be useful to return and work with closer to real time information for those things they are tracking that change often. However, to actually use the dataset, establishing connections between organization/facility identifiers and other properties would be better done with some prep work using bulk data from OpenSecrets. I requested that as well, but my request needs to be approved.\n",

    "I took this about as far as I can from this point. The actual funding data through the API appears to be summarized to the top (n) contributions and will not provide everything. I can plug in state and district to get the candidate and their ID and then get their top contributions for a given election cycle, but this does not turn anything up for our particular violator that we could get a match on. The web page lists a number for Bay Ltd, so it must be in OpenSecrets' data. We'll have to see if they supply that in their bulk data download."
